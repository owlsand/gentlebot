# Gentlebot Daily Prompt Templates
# =================================
# Human-curated prompts designed for the Gentlefolk community.
# No LLM generation - just template selection and rotation.
#
# Key principles:
#   - Human voice > LLM voice
#   - Specific > Vague
#   - Opinionated > Neutral
#   - Low barrier to entry (everyone can answer in 1 sentence)
#   - Fun/playful tone (friend group, not workplace)
#   - Food debates are gold (universal, low stakes, endless opinions)
#
# Types:
#   - text: Regular text prompts posted as messages
#   - poll: Native Discord polls (one-tap voting)
